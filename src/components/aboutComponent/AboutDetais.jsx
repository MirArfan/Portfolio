                I’m Mir Arfan Uddin, a recent graduate in Computer Science and Engineering from the International Islamic University Chittagong.

                In addition to my studies, I completed a three-month full-stack training program at Spring Rain Pvt Ltd, where I gained hands-on experience with technologies like JavaScript, React, Node.js, AWS, and DynamoDB.
